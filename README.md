# Placental-single-cell-transcriptome
Overview
This project focuses on the comparative single-cell transcriptome analysis of placental tissues across multiple species. The goal is to identify conserved and species-specific gene expression patterns, providing insights into placental biology, trophoblast differentiation, and evolutionary adaptations.
